A long race track, also using public roads, in France.
A classic 24-h event is held on this circuit every June.
This version contains the track in the 2007 setup.

Credits:
I've shamelessly 'stolen' some textures from Andrew Sumner's excellent TORCS tracks.
Also, Vdrift provided quite some inspiration for the track and served as a good base for textures.

Thanks to:
-Mart Kelder (providing script to check height data against the VDrift version of the track)
-'jensjensen' on Panoramio (for excellent photos)
-Andrew Sumner (technical info, tips, inspiration)
-Google Earth ;)
