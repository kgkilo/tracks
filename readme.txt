About the East circuit (kilo):

The East circuit incorporates the main straight, the curvy S section
and a brave right-hand shortcut that leads back to finish line.
It cuts away the distant back parts of the original track,
so spectators can enjoy real fast-paced racing, packed with
lots of action in a stadium-like environment.

In the simulation, I've used Andrew's splendid track,
merged the shourtcut section into it, added the 3D scenery
for the shortcut area and cut away the West part of the track,
invisible for normal views.

Similarly a West circuit could be produced with little effort - who knows... ;)
