Track name: honshu

Based on the kart track near the West end of Suzuka Circuit.

http://www.kartingasia.com/kart_tracks/suzuka-kart-track-t32.html

The original karting track is 1264 metres long, however to make it
drivable for racing cars I've increased it's length by 3, keeping
every turn's arc intact.
Also to make it more interesting, I've added quite some variety
in the altitude changes.
