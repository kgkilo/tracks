1-3: 55.33
3-5: 55.43

10-12: 52.5

Mapping such a long track in TrackEditor is hard.
So I've cut AVUS's sat photo into 3 separate JPG files and made
3 distinct tracks. Then I've merged them.
1st section is from Sudkurve to the kink where the road direction changes slightly, from 55.43 deg to 52.4 deg.
2nd section is from the kink unto the start of the Nordkurve region, exactly
3rd section is the Nordkurve and surroundings.
